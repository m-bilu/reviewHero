# reviewSummary Project
#### Goal:
 Build a dashboard using the BERT and Pegasus Transformer Encoder/Decoder models to provide digestable analytics on a restaurants performance. 

- We scrap Yelp! reviews on an inputted restaurant name.
- We pass each review into BERT to produce an associated rating column
- We graph the distribution of high/low comments, giving the viewer an understanding of outlying observations and general trend regarding reviews
- We pass the first and last quartile of reviews into Pegasus to produce the summarized reason why the 1st quartile gave such low reviews, and why the last quartile gave such nice reviews.

This tool is ment to help restaurants acquire a deep insight into the relationship with their audience, to understand the prevelance/extremity of certain complements and criticisms, along with quick pointers on how to fix the restaurant's most pressing issues/capture it's most successful trait.
