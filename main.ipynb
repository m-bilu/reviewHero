    "We graph the distribution of high/low comments, giving the viewer an understanding of outlying observations and general trend regarding reviews\n",
    "We pass the first and last quartile of reviews into Pegasus to produce the summarized reason why the 1st quartile gave such low reviews, and why the last quartile gave such nice reviews.\n",
    "This tool is ment to help restaurants acquire a deep insight into the relationship with their audience, to understand the prevelance/extremity of certain complements and criticisms, along with quick pointers on how to fix the restaurant's most pressing issues/capture it's most successful\n",

      "['Chicken Shawarma Platter and Greek SaladThis was FANTASTIC! The Shawarma was outstanding and filling and the salad was outstanding! Will definitely be going back', \"Four words; they can do betterComing here from living in an Arab country for most of my life, the chicken shawarma they make here is very disappointing. But I know a lot of people who live this place, I just don't get the hype. I guess everyone's taste buds are just different idk\", '10/10. Fries have flour on them I think tho, so not GF friendly, but yum. The guys were nice when I went.', \"Been here a few times and always get lazeez on the rocks. I've had it with rice, fries, and potatoes but I think that my favourite combination would be half fries and half rice. Potatoes are $1 extra and salads are $3 extra. Their sauces are really good! Wish they put a little bit of veggies in their regular meals, would make the meal more refreshing. Proportions are pretty large/decent size. The large was $8.99 and the regular was $6.99zStaff were okay, could tell they were high, saw one holding cigarettes (with plastic gloves on), put them away, then proceeded to prepare food..\", \"Exam season in full swing and I've pretty much lost the little motivation I had to cook my own meals, so I've been resorting to getting take outs for a while. After the disappointment that was Shawerma Plus I didn't feel like trying out a similar restaurant, but my friend convinced me to give Lazeez a try because apparently, the portions are a lot better. I got the Regular sized Lazeez on the Rocks platter ($6.99) with half fries half rice (+$1) per my friend's recommendation. It was a generous layer of shawarma beef on top of rice and fries, with a think layer a garlic sauce drizzled on top with a dash of hot sauce. It was sooooo greasy and also soooooo satisfying. Definitely the comfort food I needed after a long day of studying!!! The portion size was good too, I had enough leftover for a second meal the following day, and it still tasted decent after getting reheated in the microwave. Would definitely revisit, and hope the new location at Waterloo plaza will offer the same quality of food as this location.PS. the hot sauce is VERY spicy, don't try to test your limits by asking for too much\", \"Cheap but you get what you pay for.I tried the lazeez on the sticks. (Basically lazeez on the rocks with fries) It was pretty cheap, only 8.99 for a large and a little more than 10 after tax.Overall it was kinda boring. Yes, it is meat on fries with sauce. It was pretty decent at the beginning, but then you realize it is just a bucket of fries and meat, and the pieces of meat are lower quality when compared with any of the shawarma places in the surrounding area (shawarma royale, shawerma plus, mozy) I got the medium heat, but found that pretty spicy. I usually get hot sauce at mozy and the otherwise, but the level 3 medium felt flaming.I'll probably try their shawarma some other time to compare between the shawarma places.\", \"I like this location. The young guy who works there is friendly and works fast. I haven't had a bad experience here yet\", \"I was never really a fan of shawarmas and didn't know anything about good shawarma places around until a friend recommended Lazeez to me. I decided to give this place a try because why not. I mean who really wants to cook dinner during midterms week anyways right? I ordered the recommended and most basic dish there which was the chicken shawarma wrap with mid spice. I always thought I could take spicy foods well but after having their shawarma I question my spice tolerance...For the price, the portion you get is not bad and the service was pretty quick. I would have to say this place did live up to its hype as other shawarma places like Shawarma Plus didn't do me justice (shawarma was a bit too dry for my liking) and I'll probably go back again if I'm craving shawarmas.\", \"Staff is very rude and I've noticed this at more than one location that they are busy chatting amongst themselves and they practically throw the food at the counter and turn their back as they continue chatting. It just seems like they  don't appreciate or put much stalk in being generally courteous or respectful towards customer. I have noticed this several times at multiple locations now and I was being careful not to be rude to them because I want to leave a fair review. Also, I wasn't entirely sure why they are behaving this way because until last year I found their service to be ok but it just seems their success may be getting to their heads or they just don't appreciate customers. In that case, Its just fair to take my business somewhere else and spend money elsewhere. Enough with this rude customer service model.\", \"Lazeez offers a variety of grilled Middle Eastern foods with most opting for either a chicken shawarma wrap or plate. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate which also came with a side salad. I found that the rice was cooked well, with a slight bite to it. I like it, do normal people like it like that? Salad was plain, just lettuce, pickled vegetables and onions with a light dressing. The chicken was similar to Mozy's, albeit with slightly larger pieces (I assume you know Mozy's if you're reading this...) so I would say it's better. The staff here were definitely high and were super confused with everything, though this was pretty comical. Overall, I'd come back here over Mozy's but Shawarma Plus is still the top dog!\"]\n",

       "[\"Four words; they can do betterComing here from living in an Arab country for most of my life, the chicken shawarma they make here is very disappointing. But I know a lot of people who live this place, I just don't get the hype. I guess everyone's taste buds are just different idk\",\n",
       " \"Cheap but you get what you pay for.I tried the lazeez on the sticks. (Basically lazeez on the rocks with fries) It was pretty cheap, only 8.99 for a large and a little more than 10 after tax.Overall it was kinda boring. Yes, it is meat on fries with sauce. It was pretty decent at the beginning, but then you realize it is just a bucket of fries and meat, and the pieces of meat are lower quality when compared with any of the shawarma places in the surrounding area (shawarma royale, shawerma plus, mozy) I got the medium heat, but found that pretty spicy. I usually get hot sauce at mozy and the otherwise, but the level 3 medium felt flaming.I'll probably try their shawarma some other time to compare between the shawarma places.\",\n",
       " \"I was never really a fan of shawarmas and didn't know anything about good shawarma places around until a friend recommended Lazeez to me. I decided to give this place a try because why not. I mean who really wants to cook dinner during midterms week anyways right? I ordered the recommended and most basic dish there which was the chicken shawarma wrap with mid spice. I always thought I could take spicy foods well but after having their shawarma I question my spice tolerance...For the price, the portion you get is not bad and the service was pretty quick. I would have to say this place did live up to its hype as other shawarma places like Shawarma Plus didn't do me justice (shawarma was a bit too dry for my liking) and I'll probably go back again if I'm craving shawarmas.\",\n",
       " \"Staff is very rude and I've noticed this at more than one location that they are busy chatting amongst themselves and they practically throw the food at the counter and turn their back as they continue chatting. It just seems like they  don't appreciate or put much stalk in being generally courteous or respectful towards customer. I have noticed this several times at multiple locations now and I was being careful not to be rude to them because I want to leave a fair review. Also, I wasn't entirely sure why they are behaving this way because until last year I found their service to be ok but it just seems their success may be getting to their heads or they just don't appreciate customers. In that case, Its just fair to take my business somewhere else and spend money elsewhere. Enough with this rude customer service model.\"]"

Proportions are pretty large/decent size.

After the disappointment that was Shawerma Plus I didn't feel like trying out a similar restaurant, but my friend convinced me to give Lazeez a try because apparently, the portions are a lot better. I got the Regular sized Lazeez on the Rocks platter ($6.99) with half fries half rice (+$1) per my friend's recommendation. It was a generous layer of shawarma beef on top of rice and fries, with a think layer a garlic sauce drizzled on top with a dash of hot sauce. It was sooooo greasy and also soooooo satisfying. Definitely the comfort food I needed after a long day of studying!!! The portion size was good too, I had enough leftover for a second meal the following day, and it still tasted decent after getting reheated in the microwave. Would definitely revisit, and hope the new location at Waterloo plaza will offer the same quality of food as this location.PS. the hot sauce is VERY spicy, don't try to test your limits by asking for too much\",\n",

I ordered the chicken shawarma plate which also came with a side salad. I found that the rice was cooked well, with a slight bite to it. I like it, do normal people like it like that? Salad was plain, just lettuce, pickled vegetables and onions with a light dressing. The chicken was similar to Mozy's, albeit with slightly larger pieces (I assume you know Mozy's if you're reading this...) so I would say it's better. The staff here were definitely high and were super confused with everything, though this was pretty comical. Overall, I'd come back here over Mozy's but Shawarma Plus is still the top dog!\"]"
